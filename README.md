## Why I Think It Interesting

- The Reddit link includes some discussions that cover the definition of software engineering and what the subject is used for. I think that has solved many of my confusions.
- Reddit provides a platform for free discussions, where I could get helpful thoughts and opinions from real people, perhaps some other more experienced students or engineers.

## Comment from Zheqi Zhang
What I liked about this thread is that it separates software engineering from just programming. A lot of the replies emphasize tradeoffs, reliability, and coordination—things you only really notice when multiple people maintain the same codebase over time. That matches what we’re practicing here with branches and pull requests: the process matters as much as the code.
